<a href="https://www.twitter.com" "="" target="_blank"> <img alt="Twitter" src="https://assets.stickpng.com/images/580b57fcd9996e24bc43c53e.png" width="80" height="80"></a>
<h3 style="color:black;">Twitter is a website where users can already interact and communicate by quickly and effectively sending messages. Tweets can always be posted by users, which include text, images, videos, and links. On that same website, Twitter, users exchange straightforward messages known as tweets. Tweeting seems to be the practice of sending short messages to anyone and everyone who follows you on Twitter in the hopes that their interests and needs will be satisfied. Twitter is a social media platform with the primary goal of bringing people together and enabling users to communicate with those they follow by sharing their ideas and feelings.</h3>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com" "="" target="_blank"> <img alt="Instagram" src="https://assets.stickpng.com/images/580b57fcd9996e24bc43c521.png" width="80" height="80"></a>
<h3 style="color:black;">You can publish photos on this website. Unlike the other apps, Instagram requires users to share a picture once instead of messages. It may also be used to communicate with the individuals you try to speak with. The attractiveness of it is that you may observe other people's photographic abilities. Instagram's users can only share photographs or videos with other people.</h3>

<h3 style="color:black;">This is a free web-based note-taking application. You may include any kind of note, including links, concepts, or simply simple text. That would be really helpful, especially if you really are conducting research, since you may include the information you discover. Whenever I see important information for activities or any schoolwork, I have used this method, just like anyone. It is especially beneficial for students with lots of extracurricular activities.</h3>

<h3 style="color:black;">Anyone can work on their grammar and paraphrasing on just this website. You can still use it whether you're confused about understanding English grammar or are having a hard time learning it. Because this site arranges your English in such a way that you may apply it when you're having some trouble, your paragraph, sentence, or even other sort of writing will benefit from all of this. For anyone else to better understand it, especially students, this website is really helpful.</h3>

<h3 style="color:black;">It enables rapid and simple access to information for people all around the world. The purpose of YouTube is to enable simple and cost-free online video sharing. Many videos that discuss living creatures, animals, or anything else are educational or otherwise. Vlogs are popular videos created by youtubers with the intention of entertaining viewers. You may view music videos, entertainment videos, cooking tutorials, inspirational quotes, and more on YouTube. Additionally, young people utilize this website to subscribe to and follow their favorite celebrities as well as other YouTubers.</h3>
