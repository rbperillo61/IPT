<h3 style="color:black;">This is the task that Acivity 2 (a webpage) assigned to me on April 7, 2022; it was turned in on April 9, 2022, at 4:00 p.m., and I got a score of 92/100. All you have to do is pick five (5) websites and describe each one to them in your own words. The links to the websites you specified above should be in a table at the bottom or at the end of the page, and clicking on those links should take you to that particular website.</h3></div>

<h3 style="color:black;">The third task I completed is similar to activity 2, but for the disappearance of the table below and the websites' logos, which are clickable and direct users to the website you choose after clicking on them. I received a score of 91/100 for this activity, which was completed with each other on April 23, 2022. The day to pass is the same day, which is April 23, 2022, at 5:00 p.m.</h3></div>

<h3 style="color:black;">The fourth activity we finished was user/home, where the user entered personal data such as name, birthplace, civil status, religion, citizenship, and creator's photo. Additionally, we will also create a home that includes activities 3 and 4 combined; its logo should be pleasant as well. You will also be there when you click. My score was 92/100; it was made on April 30, 2022, and the pass was on May 3, 2022, at 11:59 p.m.</h3>

<h3 style="color:black;">Activity 5 is the family section, where each member of your family's photos should be displayed and clickable. and when it is clicked, any image of the family member will appear. This is similar to Activity 4, except that the information provided differs depending on which member of your family you clicked. I received a 95/100 on this task, which is due on May 21, 2022, and the pass is valid until May 23, 2022, at 11:59 p.m.</h3>
